## Usage

## Development
The project is to be developed in ASP.NET and .NET Blazor to keep it consistent between services. 

To start out, a database and API will be hosted on-prem where it is exposed by a domain. This solution may not be sufficient as the project grows, in which it may need to be moved into the cloud. Therefore, the API is to be deployable by a docker container. 

The frontend will be developed as a .NET Blazor Server application. 

## Licence
